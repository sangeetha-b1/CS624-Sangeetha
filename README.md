Input:
The user does not provide any dynamic input to this mobile application.  Rather, it depends on data that is hardcoded into the software itself.  The user's name, degree program, and school name are the three text strings that make up the input.  These values function as static material that will be shown on the screen and are immediately entered into the Text components of the code.

Proces:
Expo and React Native were used in the app's development.  One View, three Text components, and one StyleSheet are its five main constituents.  The code processes the hardcoded data when the application launches, operating within the primary function (such as App or HomeScreen).  The styling logic uses React Native styles to center the text components and apply a yellow background.

Output:
The output is a mobile screen with a yellow background displaying the name, degree program, and school name in a readable format. The text appears centered and clearly styled for easy viewing
